# Nano-Javassist
This repo contains examples of Javassist operating principles.

++ Javassist is a Java library providing a means to manipulate the Java bytecode of an application. In this sense Javassist provides the support for structural reflection, i.e. the ability to change the implementation of a class at run time. Bytecode manipulation is performed at load-time through a provided class loader.
